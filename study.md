# Ruby vs. JavaScript Arrays Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [Ruby](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/ruby)
-   [Ruby Arrays](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/ruby-arrays)
-   [JavaScript Reference Types](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/js-reference-types)

## Compare and Contrast

Briefly describe the similarities and differences between `push`, `pop`,
`unshift`, `shift` in Ruby and JavaScript.

Include differences in return value and chain-ablilty

| method                  | Differences | Similarities |
|-------------------------|-------------|--------------|
| `push`                  |             |              |
| `<<` (compare to`push`) |             |              |
| `pop`                   |             |              |
| `unshift`               |             |              |
| `shift`                 |             |              |


## Repeat Lab for JavaScript

Working in [bin/study.js](bin/study.js) (storing the results of any access in `tmp`
for display):

-   Assign `20` to the element at `length+1`.
-   Access the 3rd element from the end of an array length of 5.
-   Access element 9 for a length of 5 elements.
-   Assign [-12, -49] to the range starting from 5th element from the end,
    for a length of 3.
-   Access all the elements starting at index 1.


## Repeat Bonus for JavaScript

In [bin/study.js](bin/study.js), use a block initializer with new Array to create a
JavaScript array with ten elements where elements are equal to their index
multiplied by 2.
